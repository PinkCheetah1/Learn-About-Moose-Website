### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?
Signing up on W3Schools so I could see what sections I'd gone through was really helpful for keeping me on track with my learning
- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
Deciding to have a second page halfway through did complicate the project quite a bit
- How can you improve in the next module?
Next time, I'd like to start out with a more clear set of ideas for this I'd like to include and how I could structure them so I don't have to move stuff around so much.
