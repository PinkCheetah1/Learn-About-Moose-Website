Notes from 3/3/25

s1 - Hello world 
    - Class plan

s2 - Language learning
    - Get an idea of how much you know

s3 - Study a library (Real world application. Has documentation, examples, etc.)

s4 - Build a library
    - Plan unit tests

s5 - Write something using your library

s6 - App Using???? What does this mean? 


How to find the right resources: (imagine we are learning Swift)
- Just look it up
- W3schools is so good
- Big youtube crash courses 
- Original website
- ChatGPT
- Go find the Big Name who knows everything, they probably have resources
- Tutorials and courses
- Books (You can annotate and tag things)


(Q) - How do I set everything up so I can run things? This is overwhelming. 
(A) - Find a tutorial. 
    Make a tutorial if you need. Save it. You will probably need it later :]
    Make a simple hello world project to make sure you have it all set up! 
(Q) - How do I create a good plan if I don't know what I'm capable of in this Language
    or what needs to be done before I can even use it? 

Actually put in the practice and build things 
Figure out what you need? 

How do I know I've learned enough? You can teach it to someone else. Probably still don't know enough
but that's okay

Open terminal 
- use man <command> OR 
- <command> --help (this lists all things that can be done with that?)

Use it, mess it up, start over, try again, mess it up again. 

Tools - OverTheWire offers Bandit to help you learn terminal commands
