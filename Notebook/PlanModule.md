### Software Description 
I plan to write a simple web page and describes some things about moose. It will be a simple, informational
page about why moose are the best ever. It will also describe why I want to ride a moose. 
This page will have lots of pictures of great moose and descriptions about why they are great
and fun buttons you can press that do nothing (yet). 
I think there will also be links to websites about moose if that is possible. We'll see. 
I will later develop this into a page that has fun buttons you CAN press with lots of moose things.

### Identify Risks
Identify at least two risks that you feel will make it difficult to succeed in this module.  Identify an action plan to overcome each of these risks.

#### Risk 1
Not having enough to do, since HTML is pretty simple

##### Action Plan
As researching, make running list of possible stretch projects or things to research. Leave room for exploring CSS/JS inclusion.

#### Risk 2
Not actually getting the work done ._. 

##### Action Plan
Fill out calendar with all scheduled activities to ensure everything will actually fit. Set aside space/time for research and work. 
Use ChatGPT if I get confused, frustrated, or stressed. Eliminate roadblocks and then continue working.
