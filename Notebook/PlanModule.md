### Software Description 
I plan to write a simple web page and describes some things about moose. It will be a simple, informational
page about why moose are the best ever. It will also describe why I want to ride a moose. 
This page will have lots of pictures of great moose and descriptions about why they are great
and fun buttons you can press that do nothing (yet). 
I think there will also be links to websites about moose if that is possible. We'll see. 
I will later develop this into a page that has fun buttons you CAN press with lots of moose things.
